# IntroML
## Task 0

* [sample.csv](sample.csv), [train.csv](train.csv) and [test.csv](test.csv) were provided in the handout
* [predict.py](predict.py) is a script that computes the mean from the rows in [test.csv](test.csv) and writes them to [results.csv](results.csv)
* [evaluate.py](evaluate.py) is a script that checks if the implementation of [predict.py](predict.py) is correct. The files necessary for the checks have to be generated by modifying the filenames in [evaluate.py](evaluate.py)
* [results.csv](results.csv) contains the predictions made from the data in [tst.csv](test.csv). This is the file to be handed in. 
* [train_results.csv](train_results.csv) contains predictions about the data in [train.csv](train.csv) used for checking correctness. This file can be safely ignored.
